	    <h1 class="white">How has Canada changed</h1>
        <p class="box"> Since Canada was founded in 1867, it has undergone<br>
		many changes both physically, and politically. In 1867,<br> 
        the population was just over 3 million but now, it is<br>
        close to 40 million. Canada has also become one of the<br>
        most diverse countries in the world. In 1913, almost<br> 
        half a million people immigrated to Canada. Nowadays,<br> 
        almost 300 000 people immigrate to Canada each year.<br>
        About 1 in 5 people in Canada were born in another<br> 
        country. The population has also become much more urban,<br>
        with over 80% of people living in urban residences.</p>

        <p class="box">One major occurence that changed Canada was the<br>
        Industrial  Revolution. Due to this, Canada experienced<br>
        a huge growth in factory work and industrialisation. In<br>
        the early 20th century, a huge number of immigrants<br> 
        arrived in Canada, broadening the ethnic makeup.After<br>
        World War II, Canada experienced an economic boom. The<br>
        discovery of oil in Alberta made Canada a leading<br>
        petroleum producer.Canada was also one of the most<br> 
        important in industries such as car-building and<br>
        chemical processing. Since the confederation, Canada<br>
        has gained a few new provinces, such as Saskatchewan<br> 
        and Nunavut.</p>

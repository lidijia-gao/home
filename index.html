		<h3 class="white"> The Palaeoindians </h3>
        <p> The first humans to arrive in Canada were prehistoric humans who<br>
            arrived in northwestern Yukon over 12 000 years ago. They crossed<br> 
            a land bridge which connected Siberia with Alaska and modern day<br> 
            Canada. Eventually, they spread all across North America. These<br>
            people were known as the Palaeoindians. They were considered<br> 
            Indiginous peoples. Back then, Canada was still covered in huge<br> 
            ice sheets. The palaeoindians ate and hunted caribou, and muskoxen<br>
			among other animals. They also fished, and hunted small game to<br> 
            support themselves. By 10 000 years ago, they habited most of Canada.<br>
            The Indiginous people created their own society and customs.<br> 
            Indiginous art was discovered in various places dating back to<br> 
            around 2000-3000 years ago. Around the same time, evidence<br>
            offarming was also discovered.</p>

		<h3 class="white">European Arrival</h3>
		<p> The discovery of Canada by the europeans started in the 16th<br>
        century. A French explorer named Jacques Cartier travelled across<br> 
        the Atlantic Ocean in search for new land for the King. He landed<br>
        near what is now Gaspe, Quebec. Cartier was excited, but failed to<br>
        create a permanent settlement. In 1603, a person named Samuel de<br>
        Champlain founded a colony in Canada known as New France that<br> 
        resided along the St. Lawrence river. He created many notable cities<br>
        that still exist today, including Quebec City and Port-Royal. Samuel<br>
        de Champlain was one of the most important people in shaping Canada.<br>
        The government of France create the establishment of Montreal which<br> 
        is still one of the most important cities in Canada today. The British<br>
        landed in North America near the same time as Champlain did. They<br> 
        created settlements along the east coast of what is now the US. The<br>
        British and the French were both very competitive and determined to<br> 
        claim new land. One of the most significant economical industries<br> 
        was the Fur Trade. Animals (especially beavers) were killed, and<br> 
        their pelts were sent back to Europe to be made into clothing. There<br>
        was a lot of competition between the nations as to who had more <br>
        control over the industry. By the 18th century, tensions were really<br>
        high. The Seven Years War started in 1756 as a result of worsening<br>
        relations between France and England. The war was won by England,<br>
        and most of France's territory was given to England. However,<br> 
        England turned New France into a British Colony named Quebec, which<br>
        operated under the Quebec Act, which preserved French Culture. </p>
